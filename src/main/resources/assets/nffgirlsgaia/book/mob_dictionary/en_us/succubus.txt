The Succubus is a common low-level demon in the Nether. They are able to heal themselves when attacking their target.

The method of getting friendly with the Harpy is similar to Imps (HMaG). You must drop the item on the ground. They will
pick the item up, watch it for a few seconds
like the Piglin, and consume the item. The Succubus' favorite items are  Nether Star and Golden Apple, and also receive
the Golden Tropical Fish, Gilded Blackstone, Lemon, Crimson Fungus, Warped Fungus and Apple.

Unlike Imps, they are not able to locate the Ancient Debris. (May be added in the future)
