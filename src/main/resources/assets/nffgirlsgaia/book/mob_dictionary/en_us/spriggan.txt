The Spriggan is the spirit of plants, found at night in the Forest biomes. Unlike Dryads, they are much more hostile and
fierce, and are able to get invisible when attacking their target.
<NEWLINE>
To get friendly with a Spriggan, you must give them Regenerate III effect of over 10 seconds with the splash potion, and
then give them items. They love Cureberries, Randomberries, XP Berries and Mysterious Petals, and also receives
Spore Blossoms and other flowers.

After getting friendly, they will no longer hide themselves.
