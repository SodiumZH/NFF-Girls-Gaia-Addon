The Harpy is a common creature found in the Plain, Forest and Badlands.
<NEWLINE>
The method of getting friendly with the Harpy is similar to their HMaG variants. To get friendly with a Harpy,
instead dropping the item on the ground, you need to directly give them items by right-clicking.
As the progress increases, they will get Strength effect. Each 20% progress will
provide 1 level of the effect.

The Harpy's favorite item is the Golden Apple, and also receives the Golden Tropical Fish and cooked meat.
