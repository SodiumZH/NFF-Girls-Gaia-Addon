The Banshee is a non-material spirit which can easily get through solid blocks. They fly in the sky of the Plateau bioms
at night but vanish immediately under the sun.
<NEWLINE>
The method of getting friendly with the Banshee is the same as their HMaG variants. As they can be attracted by death,
you must put 8 Wither Roses around, and carry a Wither effect. Then you can give them items to get friendly. They love
Soul Cake Slice, and also receives Soul Apple and Soul Powder.

After getting friendly, they will still vanish under the sun, but this can be prevented by equip them with a Resistance Amulet
or a Soul Amulet.
